# About

When is it that an Event library that offers convenience to utilize events on Roblox with more flexibility and reduces the need for BindableEvents? When is.

Clean up the mess and get started on a new journey with When.

## When Can Improve Your Experience

What can improve the experience? When you have the tools built-in to easily have your scripts communicate from lines to lines and script to another.

### Adaptive with Intent

When allows you to create classes with connections. When allows you organize repeatable codes in one script. When allows selective connecting and disconnecting. When allows you to do it once, or over and over again. It is a great extension and grants developers the privilege to write their collaborative coding environment with ease.

### Fastened Tight

When is made with neatness and reusability in mind to prevent cluttering. When allows individuals to set the rules on when an event is allowed to be fired without gating on every connected functions. Instead of being loose, When allows you to be specific on which instruction matters the most with keys.

### Familiar

Don't worry about the burden of learning only to use adjustable events that should suit you. When is an OOP module that creates table processes input and behaves almost exactly the same as Roblox events, except it's made to suit you.

### Not far yet...

When is still in the perfecting phase and it can be further improved. There is more to come. You have the chance to contribute to it.
